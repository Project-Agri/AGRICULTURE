TESTING:
-------

* Testing in python is a huge topic and can come with a lot of complexity, but it doesn't need to be hard.

* Testing flow chart will be as follows:
  
    requirement analysis
	  !
    test plan creation
	  !
    test case creation
	  !
    test case execution
	  !
    defect logging
	  !
    defect fix & re-verification

-> Requirement analysis:

* A software requirements specification(SRS) is a document that contains description about how the system is expected to perform. 

  -> Challenges:
      
      * we cannot gather all information at one time.
      * Lots of discussion needed. 

-> Test plan creation:

* It's a document developed by test manager. It is set of ideas that guides and is created to inform all the managers, testers, developer about the testing process.

* It has very high importance. 

* Test plan contains detailed understanding of workflow. It consist test templates which has introduction, scope, test strategy, environment requirements, test schedule, functions to be tested, tools, documentation and approvals.

* Success or failure will depend upon how the test is been carried out. This phase is important in testing software life cycle.

-> Actual testing:
   --------------

* In this phase, application build is ready and out to find bugs. 

* Testing is a heavy process which itselt is error regrettable. 

-> Before release:

* Before releasing the software in the market, quality of products is ensured. Once a software is built, it is tested several times.

-> Conclusion: 

* The existance of both manual testing and automation testing forces us to think about our choice of tools, thier cost, and the benefit they will provide.

* Manual testing help us understand the entire problem and explore other angels of tests with flexibility.
